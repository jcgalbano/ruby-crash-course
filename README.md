# Ruby for Busy People
## Ruby Code Execution
```ruby
  ruby <path-to-your-file.rb>
```
## Primer
Ruby is an interpreted dynamic programming language. It was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto in the mid 1990's, otherwise known as 'Matz' in the Ruby community. It was created to make programming 'fun' as described by Matz. Unlike other programming languages with a boxedway of doing things, Ruby applies the 'Principle of Least Surprise' almost perfectly, meaning that whatever you already learned from other languages is not wasted, as there are a lot of ways to do one thing in Ruby. Everything in Ruby is an object, meaning everything is bound to the object-oriented principles. This coupled with sublime syntax, makes Ruby a very attractive choice for both beginner and advanced programmers alike.
```ruby
  # Try it!
  'Hello World'.class
  1.class
  [1, 2, 3].class
```
